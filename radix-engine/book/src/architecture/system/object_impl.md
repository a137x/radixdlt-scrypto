# Object Implementation

The system layer defines the [Object](../application/object/README.md) abstraction on top of the
kernel's [Node](../kernel/node.md) abstraction.

Every object is mapped to a unique node and the partition numbers of every node are
mapped in the following manner:

|                   | Partition Number |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Type Info         | 0                |
| Schema Data       | 1                |
| Object Modules    | 2-31             |
| Reserved          | 32-63            |
| Application State | 64-255           |

## Type Info

For a given object, type-related info is stored under the object's `NodeId` in the TypeInfo
substate found in `PartitionNumber 0` and `SubstateKey::Field 0`. This includes information such as:
* [BlueprintId](../application/object/blueprint_id.md)
* [Features](../application/object/features.md)
* [Generic Substitutions](../application/object/generic_substitutions.md)
* [Inner/Outer](../application/object/inner_outer_objects.md)
